# kinopio-client

<img src="./src/assets/logo-base.png" alt="logo" width="200">

The place for people to tap, drag, and smile.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/pketh/kinopio-client.git
cd kinopio-client
npm install
npm install -g @vue/cli
npm install -g hostile
hostile set localhost kinopio.local
```

## Run

```
$ npm run serve
$ https://kinopio.local:8080
```

## Run with Production API Server

You can force the local app to use the prod API by editing `.env.local` so that `VITE_PROD_SERVER=true`. Create your environment file by duplicating `.env.local.sample`.

When the app starts up, the `üê∏ kinopio-server URL` will be displayed in the logs.

## Debugging

	npm run lint

Use the [Vue devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) for Firefox and Chrome. For Safari, uncomment code in `main.js` then,

	./node_modules/.bin/vue-devtools

## Primary Files

| File | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `router` | Client-side routes |
| `App.vue` | Root component, used by all routes|
| `store.js` | [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) store, contains global observables and methods needed by multiple components |
| `utils.js` | Functional methods that just do dom manipulations or common tasks. These can't access components or store directly |
| `views/Space.vue` | Contains the core interaction layer which sends user inputs to painting, connecting, dragging etc. components. Also where new connections are created and checked to see if they connect |
| `views/Add.vue` | `kinopio.club/add` page for browser extensions and iOS share sheet |
| `components/Card.vue` | Displays cards from the `store`, and shows `CardDetails` |
| `components/Connection.vue` | Displays connections from the `store`, and shows `ConnectionDetails` |
| `components/Header.vue` | Used for moving between spaces, searching/filter, shows user presence, changing user prefs, and Kinopio meta options. Shown on all routes |
| `components/layers/MagicPaint.vue` | The layers used for animating painting, scroll locking on touch, and more with `<canvas>`. As well as for multiple card and connection selection which reveals `MultipleSelectedActions` |

## User States to Design For

| State | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `offline` | localstorage and API queue operations only |
| `not signed in` | localstorage only |
| `space is read only` | cannot add cards or edit |
| `space is open` | can add cards, can only edit cards they created |
| `mobile` | touch handlers, no hover, small screen |
| `desktop zoom out` | using the zoom bar or cmd+/- |
| `pinch zoom out/in` | using native touch gesture on mobile |

## Post Messages

Post messages are used to communicate with a parent `secureAppContext` environment, such as the iOS app that wraps the website in a child webview.

## How to update the 'Hello Kinopio' Space

The hello space serves as the entry point and marketing page for new users. It's generated within the app from `hello.json`.

To update it, create the space and export its json. Replace the contents of`hello.json` with the new json file.

## HTTPS Signing

> You shouldn't need to run this or update the cert until 2025, but just in case

To work with code that only works on https (e.g. clipboard copy and paste), [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) was used to create a local ssl certificate

    $ brew install mkcert
    $ mkcert -install
	$ mkdir -p .cert && mkcert -key-file ./.cert/key.pem -cert-file ./.cert/cert.pem 'kinopio.local'

## Ngrok tunnelling

use Ngrok to pipe your localhost through an external https server

(Note that dev kinopio-server connections won't work through Ngrok)

### Setup Ngrok

[login](http://ngrok.com), install ngrok, then connect ngrok to the kinopio ngrok account

    $ brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
    $ ngrok authtoken 1e2pCpJsJMwkEkqbDKF0p5eMArQ_5Ztb7NE8fqyftCnuizdab

### Run Ngrok

    $ ngrok http https://localhost:8080
