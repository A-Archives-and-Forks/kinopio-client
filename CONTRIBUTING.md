# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club), I'm grateful for your support.

## Discuss Changes Before Building

Because the kinopio-client app has a really opinionated interface, it's **strongly recommended** that you create a [forum topic](https://club.kinopio.club), or a github issue, to discuss your proposed changes beforehand. A little conversation beforehand saves hours down the road.

You should propose new features in the forum in order to get feedback from a wider audience. The easiest way to contribute and learn the codebase may be to fix [bugs reported in the forum](https://club.kinopio.club/c/support/6).

If using github issues, you should check and reference related bug reports or feature request/design discussions from the forums to add context.

Oh and do let me know if you have any questions about the code. Some parts are way messier than others.
