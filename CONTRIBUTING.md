# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club), I'm grateful for your support.

## Discuss Changes Before Building

Because the kinopio-client app has a really opinionated interface, it's **strongly recommended** that you create a [support forum topic](https://club.kinopio.club), or a github issue, to discuss your proposed changes beforehand. A little conversation beforehand saves hours down the road.

New features should be proposed in the [forums]((https://club.kinopio.club)) first in order to get feedback from non-dev users too.

The [forums]((https://club.kinopio.club)) also contain a multitude of bug reports which might serve as easier ways to contribute and learn the codebase.

If using github issues, you should check and reference related bug reports or feature request/design discussions from the [forums]((https://club.kinopio.club)) to add context.

Oh and do let me know if you have any questions about the code. Some parts are way messier than others.
