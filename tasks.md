## Tasks

You can do all these through `vue ui`.

You should use that instead, but incase you need to manually run things you can do so with these:

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
